## Usage
```bash
timer <time in seconds>
```
- `-u` Count up or down, defaults to down from given time
- `-s` Time in seconds
- `-m` Time is minutes
- `-hr` Time in hours

The times given will be summed together if more than one is specified.
But the time parameters will be ignored if a positional is given.
